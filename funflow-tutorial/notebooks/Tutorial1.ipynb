    "# First steps with `funflow`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "`funflow` is a Haskell library for defining and running _workflows_.\n",
    "\n",
    "A workflow specifies a pipeline of _tasks_ structured in a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflows in `funflow` have the great property of being __composable__ which means that  you can easily share and combine components across different workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "`funflow` supports type checking, result caching, and other features that simplify setting up your pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Let's get started_\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anatomy of a Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Flow` type captures the notion of a workflow; it takes an input and produces an output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "flow :: Flow input output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`input` and `output` are the types of the input and output values of the flow.\n",
    "For instance a flow working on numbers might have the following type signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "flow :: Flow Int Int\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes an integer as input and produces an integer as its output.\n",
    "A flow that doesn't take any input can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "flow :: Flow () Int\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a flow might request some user input or download some data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Flow` is a DAG comprising one or more `Tasks` which describe __what__ you would like to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "`funflow` works with a wide range of task granularities.\n",
    "A `Task` can be a simple Haskell function, a database query, a command to run in a Docker container, or more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, `funflow` provides several task types to support these different kinds of computations.\n",
    "These `Task`s are defined in the `Funflow.Tasks` subpackage.\n",
    "Of these types, `PureTask` is the simplest and represents  a Haskell function which has _no side effects_, like reading a file or running a command.\n",
    "Other task datatypes include `IOTask`, which runs a Haskell function that can perform I/O (e.g. reading a file), and `DockerTask`, which runs a \n",
    "[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) container.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to create a flow\n",
    "A `Flow` is most easily built either...\n",
    "1. ...with the [`toFlow` function](#to-flow), providing a task (or any value of a type with an `IsFlow` instance)\n",
    "2. ...with a [_smart constructor_](#smart-ctors), providing either a function or configuration value. Funflow provides three such smart constructors:\n",
    "    * `pureFlow`, building a flow from a non-effectful function\n",
    "    * `ioFlow`, building a flow from an effectful function\n",
    "    * `dockerFlow`, building a flow from a `DockerTaskConfig`\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"to-flow\"></a>\n",
    "### `toFlow`: create a flow from a task\n",
    "To create a `Flow` value, you can use the function `toFlow`, which can be imported from the top level `Funflow` module and is defined in `Funflow.Flow`.\n",
    "Often a `Task` value will be the argument to `toFlow`, but really it could be anything of a type for which an `IsFlow` instance is available, as that's the class that declares `toFlow`. The resulting `Flow` value can then be composed with other flows into a larger, final `Flow` DAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a `Flow` that runs a `PureTask`, incrementing its input by 1."

    "### Smart constructors: create a flow from a function (or config value)\n",
    "A single-task `Flow` like the ones above can also be created directly with a smart constructor.\n",
