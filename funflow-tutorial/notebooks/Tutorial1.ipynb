    "# First steps with `funflow`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "`funflow` is a Haskell library for defining and running _workflows_, which here we use synonymously with _data pipelines_.\n",
    "\n",
    "A workflow specifies a pipeline of _tasks_ structured in a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflows in `funflow` have the great property of being __composable__ which means that  you can easily share and combine components across different workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "`funflow` supports type checking, result caching, and other features that simplify setting up your pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Let's get started_\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anatomy of a Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "In `funflow`, the `Flow` type represents the concept of a workflow; it takes an input and produces an output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "flow :: Flow input output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`input` and `output` are the types of the input and output values of the flow.\n",
    "For instance a flow working on numbers might have the following type signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "flow :: Flow Int Int\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes an integer as input and produces an integer as its output.\n",
    "A flow that doesn't take any input can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "flow :: Flow () Int\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a flow might request some user input or download some data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Flow` is a DAG comprising one or more `Tasks` which describe __what__ you would like to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "`funflow` works with a wide range of task granularities.\n",
    "A `Task` can be a simple Haskell function, a database query, a command to run in a Docker container, or more. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different types of tasks in Funflow, each describing a specific type of computation. \n",
    "Tasks are defined in the `Funflow.Tasks` subpackage.\n",
    "The most basic task, the datatype `PureTask`, represents  a pure Haskell function which has no _side effects_ such as reading a file or running a command.\n",
    "Other task datatypes include `IOTask`, which runs a Haskell function that can perform I/O (e.g. reading a file), and `DockerTask`, which runs a \n",
    "[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) container.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to create Flows\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `toFlow` is used to construct a `Flow`.\n",
    "It can be imported from the top level `Funflow` module and is defined in `Funflow.Flow`.\n",
    "It integrates a `Task` into a `Flow` which can then be composed with other flows into a larger, final `Flow` DAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a `Flow` that runs a `PureTask`, incrementing its input by 1."
